I am currently working on a school project that involves teaching the computer how to play the game of snake using reinforcement learning. </br>
```
This "project" aims to assist femboys who struggle to play snake at a high level.
After watching the computer play Snake, you might feel even more embarrassed about your own skills, skill issues fr. 
```
Please keep in mind that this is just a school project, so you shouldn't expect any extraordinary results. <img src="https://media.tenor.com/AinmEhb2-FgAAAAC/skill-issue-emoji.gif" width="30">
